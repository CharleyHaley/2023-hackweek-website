about:
  description:
    <a href="https://escience.washington.edu/using-data-science/hackweeks/">Hackweeks</a> are participant-driven events that strive to create
    welcoming spaces for participants to learn new things, build community and
    gain hands-on experience with collaboration and team science.
    </br></br>
    GeoSmart Hackweek will focus primarily on project work, with project ideas shared in advance. There will be space for new ideas to emerge based on participant engagement. There will be about 5 hours of tutorials spread over the week, including space for participant-led tutorials. 
    </br></br>
    During the week, participants will have the opportunity to collaborate with
    their peers, share ideas, and work on projects leading to exciting results and
    discoveries. This event is open to all experience levels in machine learning
    knowledge, so whether you're a seasoned pro or just starting out, you're
    welcome to join. However, to benefit most from the event, prior knowledge of
    Python programming and data handling using common Python packages (pandas,
    xarray, etc.) is desired.

    header: "Hackweek activities will include:"
    list:
      - header: Brainstorming sessions
        description: participants can join an existing project or come
          up with ideas for projects that can be implemented using machine learning.
      - header: Tutorials
        description: participants will learn about common machine learning workflows,
          computational environments, reproducibility, and workflow management.
      - header: Data preparation
        description: participants will explore datasets to identify and
          engineer relevant variables that can be used to build machine learning models.
      - header: Models
        description: participants will work on building machine learning models using
          popular libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn.
      - header: Model validation
        description: participants can validate their models using
          cross-validation and other techniques to ensure that their models are
          robust and accurate.
      - header: Optimization
        description: participants can work on optimizing their models by
          fine-tuning hyperparameters, using feature engineering techniques, or
          other methods.
      - header: Presentations
        description: participants can share the results from projects to
          receive feedback from their peers.
      - header: Networking
        description: facilitated opportunities for networking and community
          building will be provided.
